# Example Kubernetes Workloads 

😁 Welcome! 

This repo is a work in progress, but it will eventually contain 3 different example applications that you can deploy to a Kubernetes cluster. 

Please note that these applications were created for educational purposes and are not suited for long-running production settings. 

## Symbols 
These emojis have meaning in this repo: 

* ✅ (:check_mark_button:) means that the section and code sample are complete 
* 🚧 (:construction:) means that this section and the code are incomplete 


## Examples 
These are the workloads and the kind of Kubernetes resource that serves them best: 

1. ✅ An example API written in Go that is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment
1. 🚧 A log aggregator that is deployed as a Kubernetes DaemonSet
1. 🚧 A cronjob that is deployed as a Kubernetes Job
